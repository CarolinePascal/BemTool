# BemTool
BemTool is a C++ header only library that only relies on the STL and Boost::math library.
Its main purpose is the computation of assembly routines for boundary elements. At low level,
it contains a set of elementary classes for low dimensional linear algebra (so as to deal with
geometric computations) and simplicial meshes in 1D,2D and 3D.
